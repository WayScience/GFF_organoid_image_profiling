# # Copy raw images into one folder to use for CellProfiler processing

# Currently, the images are located nest deep within multiple folders. 
# For best practices, we will copy the images (preserving metadata) to one folder that can be used for CellProfiler processing.

# ## Import libraries

import shutil


# ## Set paths and variables

# In[2]:


# Define the parent directory containing all the nested folders

nf0014_dir = parent_dir.parent / "NF0014"
